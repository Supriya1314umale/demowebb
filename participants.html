                    <p>
                        We prioritise ethical practice, sustainable workloads, and psychological safety. Supervision,
                        support, and boundaries are built into how we work.

                    <p>
                        Caseloads are designed with sustainability and clinical quality in mind. We prioritise realistic
                        session loads, flexibility based on individual capacity, and protected time for documentation,
                        reflection, and learning. Caseloads are reviewed regularly and adjusted when needed to prevent
                        burnout and support ethical care.

                    <p>
                        Supervision is regular, structured, and clinically meaningful. It is a space for reflection,
                        ethical decision-making, case discussion, and professional growth. Supervision is provided by
                        experienced clinicians and treated as an essential part of practice.

                    <p>
                        Yes. We support integrative practice and respect diverse therapeutic orientations. No single
                        model is imposed, as long as the work is ethical, evidence-informed, and responsive to client
                        needs.

                    <p>
                        Therapist wellbeing is built into our systems rather than left to individual resilience. This
                        includes manageable caseloads, flexibility, access to supervision, and a culture that respects
                        boundaries, rest, and honest conversations about capacity.

                    <p>
                        Struggle is recognised as part of human and clinical work, not as a failure. We encourage early
                        conversations, offer additional supervision or support, and make adjustments where possible. The
                        goal is care, containment, and sustainability, not performance or penalty.
